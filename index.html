I had a patch test done first and was shocked seeing only after a month of putting it off to see the patch had no hair  growing back.
I've now had sessions on my neck and back, and I'm very happy with the results. I've stuck to it with fantastic results. I'm  a very happy customer and can't wait to return for my next session.
I would hands down recommended Naheeds laser to everyone who is looking to get theirs done."</p>
